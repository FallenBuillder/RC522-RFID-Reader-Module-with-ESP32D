- Any buzzer should work with this setup because buzzers in general aren't very complicated
- the GPIO pins defined in the code may varry so you can change them accordingly to your liking


**if you have a diffrent ESP32 board connect it to the corresponding MISO , MOSI , CLK pins - they will be shown on a ESPs32 pinout in this way**
